Under construction, but basically: provide a testbed implementation!  Makes it super easy for people to play around w/ physics on your framework by using the already-made testbed tests.

Making this easy is something that I'm currently improving, but you can see an example in the jbox2d-testbed-jogl project, where the UI is replaced with a GL implementation instead of the j2d implementation.
